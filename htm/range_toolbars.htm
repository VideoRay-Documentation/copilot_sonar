<h1>7- Range Toolbars</h1>

<h2>7.1 Sonar View Range Sliders</h2>

<p>The sonar range sliders (along the immediate left side of the interface) allow you to change both the start and stop range. The Stop Range selects how far out the sonar is looking, whereas the Start Range selects the point where the sonar starts acquiring data. By using both controls you can zoom in on a target. However, note that zooming in too far can create a degraded picture because not enough data is available to fill the screen pixels, resulting in pixilation.</p>

<h2>7.2	Vehicle Range to Target Sliders</h2>

<p>To change the range of the vehicle to a target, simply click on the orange dot within the far left range slider and drag to your chosen range. The blue dot represents the current vehicle range to target. To see the value of this range, the user can simply hover the mouse over the dot and the value will be displayed. The available maximum and minimum vehicle range to target is governed by the current start/stop Sonar Range.</p>

<p><img src="../../required/images/icon_note.gif"> If the user changes the vehicle range to target and immediately afterward changes the operating depth via the waterfall, the change in depth will subsequently overrule the change in range. The result of which will be that the vehicle will operate at the current acting range of the vehicle when the depth was altered.</p>
