<h1>7- Range Toolbars</h1>

<h2>7.1 Sonar View Range Slider</h2>

<p>The sonar range slider (along the top of the interface) allows you to change both the Stop Range of the sonar. The Stop Range selects how far out the sonar is looking,. By using the control you can zoom in or out on a target. However, note that zooming in too far can create a degraded picture because not enough data is available to fill the screen pixels, resulting in pixilation.</p>

<h2>7.2	Vehicle Range to Target Sliders</h2>

<p>To change the range of the vehicle to a target, simply click on the red dot within the far left range slider and drag to your chosen range. The blue dot represents the current vehicle range to target. To see the value of this range, the user can simply hover the mouse over the dot and the value will be displayed. The available maximum and minimum vehicle range to target is governed by the current start/stop Sonar Range.</p>

<p><img src="../../required/images/icon_note.png"> If the user changes the vehicle range to target and immediately afterward changes the operating depth via the water column, the change in depth will subsequently overrule the change in range. The result of which will be that the vehicle will operate at the current acting range of the vehicle when the depth was altered.</p>
