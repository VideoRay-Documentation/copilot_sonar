<p>CoPilot Sonar is a automated pilot navigation assistance software package.  It is designed to help operators navigate a VideoRay Pro 4 ROV relative to an object using the sonar signature of that object (also referred to as a sonar target or simply, target).  Upon user selection of a sonar target, the Pro 4 will autonomously hold station relative to the target.  The user can then instruct the system to autonomously advance or retreat to a specified stand-off distance from the target.</p>
