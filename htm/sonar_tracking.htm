<h1>5 - Sonar Tracking Display</h1>

<p>The Sonar Tracking display is focused on displaying the data captured by the sonar within the current field of view. The Sonar Tracking Display will present the user with possible targets, each depicted by a yellow box. To select and lock to a target, the user must simply click on the preferred target which, once lock is achieved, will be depicted by a green box. The ROV position, relative to the target, is estimated by VideoRay Sonar CoPilot's navigation system.</p>

<p>To control the vehicle, the user may select one of two options from the Tracking Buttons located to the left of the Sonar Tracking Display.</p>

<p>Selecting Stop (Hand Icon) will instruct the vehicle to stop and hover at its current location while remaining locked to a selected target at a range depicted using the Range Toolbar (See Section 7 - Range Toolbars). Selecting Release (Joystick Icon) will allow the vehicle to fly manually.</p>
