<h1>4 - Position Information Display</h1>

<p>The Position Information Display is located at the top left of the user interface provides the user with the current position data for the ROV.</p>

<p>The Status Indicators located across the bottom of the user interface comprises many user-friendly elements, including the current navigation information, status indicators and flight mode.</p>

<h2>4.1 Position Information</h2>

<p>This position information panel provides the user with the following ROV information: heading (H) and depth (D).</p>

<p>The indicator will not be illuminated when the DP system is not running. In this instance, the sonar will not be able to find or lock to a target.</p>

<h3>4.2.2 The Position Status Indicator</h3>

<p>This indicator is illuminated when the ROV is within the tolerance range (typically a few meters of its target position. The indicator is not displayed when the ROV is not in position.</p>

<h3>4.2.3 The Joystick Indicator</h3>

<p>This indicator is displayed when the system receives a command from the joystick. The indicator is not displayed when the joystick is not considered to be in use.</p>

<p>If the joystick movement is within the specified deadband range, the system will not detect the command. For example, a joystick movement of 20% will not be detected by the system if the deadband setting is 30%.</p>
