<h1>Status Indicators and Alarms</h1>

<h2>6.1 Alarm Panel</h2>

<p>The alarm panel is displayed across the bottom of the pilot interface. It displays the current status of each software component that allows VideoRay Sonar CoPilot to run smoothly.</p>

<p>If a software component fails, its name is illuminated in the alarm panel situated along the bottom of the pilot interface.</p>

<p>In normal operation, the bar illustrated below should have no alarms illuminated; when a failure is detected the appropriate alarm will be indicated in RED.</p>

<p>Status indicators include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Standby - the system is not tracking</li>
  <li>Nav Fault - the system is unable to control the VideoRay</li>
  <li>In Position - the system is tracking a target</li>
  <li>Joystick - the Joystick is in use</li>
  <li>Sonar - the Sonar is not responding</li>
