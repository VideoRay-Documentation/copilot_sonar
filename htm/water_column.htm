<h1>6 - Water Column Display</h1>

<p>The water column display allows the user to view the area above and below the ROV in the water column. The ROV remains in the center of the display at all times.</p>

<p>Since there is no altitude sensor on the BV equipped VideoRay, the height above seabed cannot be shown.
The sea surface icon is displayed in blue. The current depth is represented by an arrow the same color as the ROV.

<h2>6.1 Alarm Panel</h2>

<p>The alarm panel is displayed across the bottom of the pilot interface. It displays the current status of each software component that allows VideoRay Sonar CoPilot to run smoothly.</p>

<p>If a software component fails, its name is illuminated in the alarm panel situated along the bottom of the pilot interface.</p>

<p>In normal operation, the bar illustrated below should have no alarms illuminated; when a failure is detected the appropriate alarm will be indicated in RED.</p>
