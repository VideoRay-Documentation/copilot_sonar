<h1>2 - General Overview</h1>

<p>VideoRay Sonar CoPilot V1.1 provides the latest generation of SMART software tools in a simple to use, pilot-friendly form. Training using VideoRay Sonar CoPilot is painless and the intuitive tools help novice users tackle even the most complex operations.<p>

<p>Pilots normally control a VideoRay ROV using thruster inputs to follow a desired course and speed.  Constant adjustments are required to correct the course and account for water current and tether drag.  Using VideoRay Sonar CoPilot, operators are able to identify objects suitable for tracking and can then maintain a stable heading and range to the target as desired, without the concern of current and tether drag.</p>

<p>Pilots using the Pro 4 ROV equipped with VideoRay Sonar CoPilot will be able to:</p>

<ul>
  <li><p></p>hold position and heading at the touch of a button;</li>
  <li><p></p>visualize current field of view as captured by the sonar;</li>
  <li><p></p>track and hold position relative to a selected target;</li>
  <li><p></p>alter the colormap of the interface to suit personal preference and current conditions;</li>
  <li><p></p>concentrate on the operations and not actual action of piloting.</li>
  </ul>

<h2>2.1 Requirements</h2>

<p>VideoRay Sonar CoPilot requires that the Pro 4 ROV is equipped with a BlueView P900 Sonar.</p>

<h2>2.2 Dynamic Positioning System</h2>

<p>A dynamic positioning (DP) system allows the ROV to automatically hold a requested position. A DP system mimics automatically what a pilot would do in adjusting the thrusters to keep the desired position.</p>

<p>VideoRay Sonar CoPilot enables object-relative station-keeping and approach; the system will maintain a constant range to target while keeping the target at the center of the sonar field of view. The user can then perform object-relative advances / retreats (reduce or increase range to target); or change depth/altitude while keeping a constant distance from the target.</p>

<h2>2.3 VideoRay Sonar CoPilot Core Features</h2>

<p>The core features of VideoRay Sonar CoPilot are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><p></p>Pilot Interface: The VideoRay Sonar CoPilot pilot interface offers the visual aid of real-time monitoring of the sonar field of view. Its non-intrusive dark background enhances the display on screen and allows the user to extract vital real-time information for piloting.</li>
  <li><p></p>Tracking: VideoRay Sonar CoPilot allows the user to track, monitor and classify multiple targets simultaneously using the simple Pilot Interface.</li>
  <li><p></p>Compatibility: VideoRay Sonar CoPilot is compatible with the latest version of the BlueView P900 Sonar devices.</li>
  </ul>

<h3>2.3.1 Tracking Module</h3>

<p>The tracking module is a navigation tool that augments the operation of the dynamic positioning system. This tool works by using sonar input, analyzing the images produced by the sonar and identifying trackable targets within the sonar field of view. If a target has been selected, the user is able to reliably and safely move the vehicle relative to the target, provided it remains within the field of view of the sonar. The tracking module has applications in sub-sea operations, such as riser tracking, that allow the vehicle to easily maintain a constant visual of the selected target.</p>
