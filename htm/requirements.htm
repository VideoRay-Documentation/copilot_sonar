<h2>Hardware</h2>

<p>Copilot Sonar requires a Pro 4 ROV system and BlueView P- or V- series 900-130 sonar (a 900-90 sonar can be used but may result in reduced performance of the tracking).  The sonar must have S2 or S3 electronics.</p>

<p><img src="../../required/images/icon_note.png"> Currently, CoPilot Sonar does not support ROVs equipped with the VectorNav compass.</p>

<h2>Software</h2>

<p>VideoRay Cockpit version 1.10.3.9 or newer.</p>

<h2>User Knowledge and Skills</h2>

<p>For best results, users should be familiar with operating a VideoRay Pro 4 and BlueView sonar and BlueView ProViewer software.</p>
