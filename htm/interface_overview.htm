<p>The VideoRay CoPilot pilot interface comprises five main elements:</p>

<ol>
  <li><p></p>Position Information Display - The position information display is the column on the left side of the interface. It provides the pilot with summary information on the current location and status of the ROV. Further status information is located in the panel at the bottom on the interface.</li>
  <li><p></p>Sonar Tracking Display - The sonar tracking display is the main panel in the pilot interface. It allows the user to monitor the sonar field of view in real-time, identifying and classifying possible targets.</li>
  <li><p></p>Range Toolbars - The range toolbars allow the user to control the position of the vehicle relative to a chosen target, to set a chosen start/stop distance for the vehicle when tracking and to alter the sonar range visible on the sonar tracking display.</li>
  <li><p></p>Water Column Display - The water column display is positioned on the right side of the interface next to the sonar tracking display. It allows the pilot to monitor and alter the depth/altitude of the ROV. A left-button mouse click in this display generates a new depth/altitude request for the ROV. A right-button mouse click has no effect in this display.</li>
  <li><p></p>Pilot Interface Toolbar - The pilot interface toolbar, located along the top of the interface, allows the user to access the additional functionality of the system.</li>
  </ol>
